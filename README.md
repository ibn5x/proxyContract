# Upgradeable Smart Contract Production Ready

I have expanded further from a basic upgradeable smart contract MVP to full professional production-ready upgradeable smart contract with pausability implementation. Not only do we solve 
all our main issues with our previous MVP contract (upgrading/adding  variables and function to storage and functional contract) We are now able to be proactive against exploits as well
by implementing pausability functionality into our production ready contract. This will grant us time to address, fix, and test bugs in our contracts and redeploy and unpause all of our critical
functions to resume normal operations
